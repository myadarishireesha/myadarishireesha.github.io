      The Canada goose is a large species of goose  with a black head and neck, white cheeks, white under its chin, and a brown body distinguish it from all other goose species. It is native to the arctic and temperate regions of North America.It is primarily herbivorous, although they sometimes eat small insects and fish.[40]  and normally migratory; often found on or close to fresh water, the estuaries, and even urban areas, being so common in some suburban areas that many people consider them pests.
      It’s size range from 75 to 110 cm (30 to 43 in) in length and have a 127–185 cm (50–73 in) wingspan.[18] The lifespan in the wild of geese who survive to adulthood ranges from 10 to 24 years.
      A Canada Goose can have between 20,000 to 25,000 feathers, providing insulation and waterproofing. They can sleep with one eye open by shutting down one side of their brain, a behaviour known as uni-hemispheric slow-wave sleep. It has been recorded flying at altitudes up to 29,000 feet.
